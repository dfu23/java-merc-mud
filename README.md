Java Merc Mud
=============

A Port of Merc Mud to Java

This is a port of the Merc Mud code in C to Java. The original C code can be found here on GitHub as 
well. This is just an exercise that I am doing in spare time and currently is not complete. This was 
my favorite version of Mud when I used to play them and the under the hood mechanics still intrigue 
me so this is my motivation for the project.

I am trying to keep most of the variable names and organization the same for now but I might refactor 
things once the major work of the port is complete. My focus is on the major objects in the game and 
the mechanics of fighting and whatnot. If you are interested in the project and have any suggestions 
please share them!

Many thanks to Alex McHale for sharing the original code!
